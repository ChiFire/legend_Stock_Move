## Brief Description

**New forms of collective intelligence have emerged with the rise of the Internet. Examples include Google, Wikipedia, etc. Not only these systems present large bodies of text on a topic (e.g. a publicly traded company of interest), but they also capture aggregated/time-stamped page-view data. The changes in content and page-views over time can help predict changes in the price of a stock or an index; a price change can only happen if the supply and demand relationship is changed. In this research, we hypothesize that combining disparate online data sources with traditional time-series and technical indicators for a stock can provide accurate predictions of a stock's next-day movement. The predictions are made based on three machine learning models: decision trees, neural networks and support vector machines. To build these models, a list of potential predictors from these data-sources have been generated. The list includes both variables (i.e. data in raw form) and features (e.g. summary statistics and predictors combining multiple variables) selected from these variables. A case study based on the AAPL (Apple NASDAQ) stock from May 1, 2012 to May 31, 2015. For this case study, several results were obtained: a) the use of Google News and Wikipedia Hits along with traditional metrics leads to improved predictions with an accuracy/hit rate >85%; b) our model outperforms several approaches from the literature; and c) our model provide insights into the effectiveness of five different targets (based on open/close price or trade volume) in predicting the next-day movement. Finally, a tool is provided to allow researchers and investors to use our approach to stocks/indices/commodities of their choice.**
